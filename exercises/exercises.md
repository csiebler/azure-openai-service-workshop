## :question: 02 - Multiple tasks in one prompt

Use the same example sentence:
```
I was enjoying the sun, but then a huge cloud came and covered the sky.
```

Come up with a prompt, that generates the following completion:

{
    "translated": "Ich genoss die Sonne, aber dann kam eine riesige Wolke und bedeckte den Himmel.",
    "negated": "I was not enjoying the sun, and no huge cloud came and covered the sky.",
    "third_person": "She was enjoying the sun, but then a huge cloud came and covered the sky."
}
```

```
Take the following sentence and perform three tasks on it:
 
1. Translate the sentence into German
2. Negate the sentence
3. Convert it into third person, and assume the person is a female.
The output should be a JSON document. Use the keys "translated", "negated" and "third_person" in the JSON. No need to include the original text.
